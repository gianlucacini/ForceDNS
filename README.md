# ForceDNS
ForceDNS is a free, open source app that forces your pc to browse the web with a custom DNS.

- You have an internet related addiction (video streaming, gambling, pornography, compulsive shopping) and you would like to stop.

## Features
- Forces your network adapter card to use a custom DNS until a set date and time
- "Locks" your settings for the selected date and time
- Hard to bypass even for a user with admin privileges

## What the hell is a DNS ðŸ˜•

Computers have no idea what google.com or any other website name means. All they understand is numbers and network addresses. 

A dns is a service that "translates" google.com into a network address, so that your browser can find the page and load it on your computer.

it's like a phonebook but for websites. 

Let's say you want to call your friend Bob. Unless you know his number, you'll have to use a phonebook to look up his name and thus find his phone number. A dns does exactly the same thing, but with website names instead of people's names.

Every time you type a website into your browser's search bar, it loads because your dns is able to find the corresponding network address in a huge database online.

## Benefits of using a custom dns over a standard one

there are many companies providing both free and paid dns servers, so the benefits can be different depending on your choice.

- Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS offers a free dns with a faster and more privacy-friendly internet experience
- OpenDNS FamilyShield offers a free dns that blocks website domains that are categorized as: Tasteless, Proxy/Anonymizer, Sexuality and Pornography

some dns servers are also able to:
- block ads 
- offer protection against phishing
- bypass censorship and geo-locked content.

Paid dns servers offer more customization and more features.
